For the tranformations, it is relatively important to be able to write custom 
transformations in Python. This is because these transformations are anyways not
executed on GPU at the moment, and additionaly they depend strongly on the data
that is used.
However, at the moment this remains tricky due to how data is loaded in an optimized
way in N2D2
