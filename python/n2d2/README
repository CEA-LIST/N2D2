n2d2 python package based on N2D2 binding

In package, "n2d2" refers to the python package, "N2D2" to the bound C++ core functions


General paradigms:
    * Merges tasks of INI files, generators and n2d2.cpp
    * Be able to use N2D2 with as little recompilation as possible
    * Use as much as possible pybind methods directly in objects, and avoid parameter reimplementations
      to avoid incoherences between n2d2 and N2D2 objects
    * Keep INI file uppercase name convention for parameters
    * Pythonic and rather similar to Pytorch (based on lists and dictionaries)
    * Hardware agnostic definitions of layers -> High level Python wrappers for all cell types
    * Topologies and layers can be defined independent of the hardware model
    * Easy access to network parameters and activations for python based analysis
