Introduction
============

For notation purposes, we will refer to the python library of N2D2 as n2d2. 
This library uses the core function of N2D2 and add an extra layer of abstraction to make the experience more user friendly. 
With the library you can import data, pre-process them, create a deep neural network model, train it and realize inference with it.
You can also import a network using the :doc:`ini file configuration<../ini/intro>` or the ONNX library.
