Introduction
============

For notation purposes, we will refer to the python library of N2D2 as n2d2. 
This library uses the core function of N2D2 and add an extra layer of abstraction to make the experience more user fiendly. 
With the library you can import data, preprocess them, create a deep neural network model, train it and make inference with it.
You will be able to create a network using the :doc:`ini file configuration<../ini/intro>` or using solely the python library.
It is also possible to import your netowrk saved with the ONNX library.
