About N2D2-IP
=============

While N2D2 is our deep learning open-source core framework, some modules
referred as “N2D2-IP” in the manual, are only available through custom
license agreement with CEA LIST.

If you are interested in obtaining some of these modules, please contact
our business developer for more information on available licensing
options:

In addition to N2D2-IP modules, we can also provide our expertise to
design specific solutions for integrating DNN in embedded hardware
systems, where power, latency, form factor and/or cost are constrained.
We can target CPU/DSP/GPU CoTS hardware as well as our own PNeuro
(programmable) and DNeuro (dataflow) dedicated hardware accelerator IPs
for DNN on FPGA or ASIC.
