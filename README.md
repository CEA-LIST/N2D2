N2D2 (for *Neural Network Design & Deployment*) is [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/)'s CAD framework for designing and simulating
Deep Neural Network (DNN), and building full DNN-based applications on embedded platforms.
N2D2 is developped along with industrial and academic partners and is open source.

## Getting the sources

Use the following command:

> git clone --recursive git@github.com:CEA-LIST/N2D2.git

It is important to specify the recursive option as it will download the PyBind submodule.

## Usage

To compile and use N2D2, please refer to the
[online documentation](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/), which
contains the following resources:
- [General presentation of the framework](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/intro/intro.html)
- [How to compile N2D2 and perform simulations](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/intro/simus.html)
- How to write neural network models
  - [With the INI interface](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/ini/intro.html)
  - [With the Python API](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/python_api/intro.html)
- How to quantize neural network models
  - [With Post-Training Quantization](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/quant/post.html)
  - [With Quantization-Aware Training](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/quant/qat.html)
- [How to export neural network models](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/export/CPP.html)
- Tutorials

The N2D2 executables and **application examples** are located in the [exec](exec) directory.


## Install Dependencies

The only mandatory dependencies for N2D2 are OpenCV and Gnuplot.

Moreover, the NVIDIA CUDA and CuDNN libraries are required to enable GPU-acceleration.
We highly recommend to use a **CUDA version higher than 10** with a **CuDNN version higher than 7**


## Docker Image

You can also pull a **pre-built docker image** from Docker Hub and run it with docker
```
docker pull cealist/n2d2
docker run --gpus all cealist/n2d2:latest
```

Another possibility is to build N2D2 from the `Dockerfile`. 
It is supplied to build images with CUDA 10.2 support and CuDNN 8.
