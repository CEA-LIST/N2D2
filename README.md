N2D2 (for *Neural Network Design & Deployment*) is [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/)'s CAD framework for designing and simulating
Deep Neural Network (DNN), and building full DNN-based applications on embedded platforms.
N2D2 is developped along with industrial and academic partners and is open source.

## Installation

### Get the N2D2 Source

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:CEA-LIST/N2D2.git
```

Specify the *recursive* option is required as it will download the PyBind submodule.

### Install Dependencies

The only mandatory dependencies for N2D2 are OpenCV and Gnuplot.

Moreover, the NVIDIA CUDA and CuDNN libraries are required to enable GPU-acceleration.
We highly recommend to use a **CUDA version higher than 10** with a **CuDNN version higher than 7**.

If you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable `N2D2_NO_CUDA=1`.

### Build on Linux

To compile N2D2 on Linux, please go to the root of the project and run the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```

You should have the `n2d2` executable in `build/bin` after the compilation.

To install the Python API in your python environment, follow the tutorial on our [doc](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/python_api/intro.html).


## Docker Image

You can also pull a **pre-built docker image** from Docker Hub and run it with docker
```
docker pull cealist/n2d2
docker run --gpus all cealist/n2d2:latest
```

Another possibility is to build N2D2 from the `Dockerfile`. 
It is supplied to build images with CUDA 10.2 support and CuDNN 8.
