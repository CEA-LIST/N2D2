N2D2 (for 'Neural Network Design & Deployment') is a open source CAD framework for
Deep Neural Network (DNN) simulation and full DNN-based applications building.
It is developped by the [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/) along with
industrial and academic partners and is open to community contributors.
The only mandatory dependencies for N2D2 are OpenCV (&ge; 2.0.0) and Gnuplot.
The NVIDIA CUDA and CuDNN libraries are required to enable GPU-acceleration.


## Usage

To compile and use N2D2, please refer to the
[online documentation](https://cea-list.github.io/N2D2-docs/), which
contains the following resources:
- General presentation of the framework;
- How to compile N2D2 and perform simulations;
- How to write neural network models;
- Tutorials.

The N2D2 executables and application examples are located in the [exec](exec) directory.


## Docker Image

You can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run it with docker
```
docker pull cealist/n2d2
docker run --gpus all cealist/n2d2:latest
```

You can also build N2D2 from the `Dockerfile`. 
It is supplied to build images with CUDA 10.2 support and cuDNN v8.
